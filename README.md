# ContentDisplayEval
A framework for testing the correctness of the visualizations rendered by in-game cameras
Work in progress. Especially cleanup and documentation.


### Dataset 
We can't disclose at the moment the used dataset. Instead we will provide an open-source game in Unreal Engine (public game engine), to let user have access to an out-of-the-box experimentation dataset.

## Pipeline and scripts for each training step provided. 
## The full trained model is available for download here: http://tinyurl.com/35e3fbym
## TODO: document more technically soon.
